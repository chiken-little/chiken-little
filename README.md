👋 Hi, I’m Harsha Mahanti
Senior Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience building Java-based, cloud-native applications and scalable backend systems, with solid full-stack exposure.

I specialize in Java, Spring Boot, and microservices, designing systems that are reliable, performant, and production-ready. Over the years, I’ve moved beyond simply “making things work” to designing architectures that scale, deploy cleanly, and are easy to maintain.

💼 What I Do

Design and build enterprise-grade backend systems using Java & Spring Boot

Develop RESTful microservices with clean API contracts and strong test coverage

Build full-stack workflows using React + Java backend services

Deploy and operate applications on AWS using CI/CD, containers, and cloud best practices

Collaborate closely with DevOps, QA, and product teams in Agile environments

☁️ Cloud & Architecture Focus

AWS-native development (EC2, RDS, S3, IAM, CI/CD pipelines)

Dockerized services and Kubernetes-based deployments

Performance optimization, caching strategies, and rate-limit handling

Secure, scalable system design aligned with cloud best practices

🧠 What I’m Currently Building

AI-powered Java Code Review & Auto-Documentation Platform

AST-based Java parsing (JavaParser)

LLM-driven structured code reviews

Automated Javadoc insertion using syntax-aware transformations

Full-stack crypto & wallet platforms

Spring Boot + React

External API integrations, payments, and real-time data handling
